The influence of the valsartan recall on clinical outcomes is unknown. We compared the risk of adverse events between hypertensive patients using valsartan and a propensity score-matched group using nonrecalled angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\n",
    "We used Optums deidentified Clinformatics Datamart July 2017 January 2019. Hypertensive patients who received valsartan or nonrecalled angiotensin receptor blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for 1 year before and on the recall date were compared. Primary outcomes were measured in the 6 months following the recall and included 1 a composite measure of all-cause hospitalization all-cause emergency department visit and all-cause urgent care visit and 2 a composite cardiac event measure of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and hospitalizations emergency department visits urgent care visits for stroke transient ischemic attack heart failure or hypertension. We compared the risk of outcomes between treatment groups using Cox proportional hazard models. Of the hypertensive patients 76 934 received valsartan and 509 472 received a nonrecalled angiotensin receptor blocker angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Valsartan use at the time of recall was associated with a higher risk of all-cause hospitalization emergency department use or urgent care use hazard ratio HR 1.02 95 percent CI 1.00 1.04 and the composite of cardiac events HR 1.22 95 percent CI 1.15 1.29 within 6 months after the recall.\n",
