Abstract: at the end of the 1990s with the advent of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia and rituximab for b cell lymphoproliferative disease with cd20 expression there wa a great conceptual evolution in the treatment of oncohematological disease researcher from around the world and the pharmaceutical industry began to focus their effort on the socalled target therapy used alone or associated with classic chemotherapeutic drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia the development of secondgeneration anticd20 antibody biosimilars pi3k phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor btk brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor and antibcl 2 drug represented mainly by venetoclax brought new broader and more effective opportunity in the treatment of this disease this breakthrough occurred mainly regarding patient with alteration in 17p or mutation of the p53 gene for whom selecting the new drug that act on b cell signaling btk and pi3k inhibitor in the first line is mandatory in fit patient with immunoglobulin heavy chain mutation it is still acceptable to use the chemotherapy regimen with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and rituximab fcr and in those who do not fit or are not igvhmutated bendamustinerituximab regimen however the firstline use of ibrutinib or venetoclax associated with immunotherapy within the concept of infinite ibrutinib or finite venetoclax treatment ha been increasingly used in the second line venetoclax ibrutinib and idelalisib have become the preferred treatment i believe that a process of instruction and decision shared with patient considering the risksbenefitscost and access to treatment should guide the choice within these concept another fundamental aspect to discus is the objective of the treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll for a specific patient the increase progressionfree survival and overall survival andor the achievement of minimal residual disease cll is the most common leukemia in adult with a median age at diagnosis of 72 year the clinical course is heterogeneous and outcome are influenced by individual clinical presentation and disease biology molecular and genomic factor including fluorescence in situ hybridization fish testing karyotype and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene ighv mutational status are important to treatment decision and to predict the clinical course however despite disease biology the presence of active disease is the most important criterion to initiate treatment in the past decade target therapy that inhibit b cell receptor signaling pathway and more recently bcl2 antagonist have emerged a a new treatment paradigm chemofree with fixed duration therapy brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor btk are a class of oral medication approved for frontline and relapsed disease effective for achieving lasting response and disease control with a good safety profile btk inhibitor are an attractive option for highrisk patient who are not candidate for an intensive regimen however it is a continuous therapy and drug resistance or severe adverse event could lead to treatment suspension bcl2 antagonist are an attractive alternative to btk inhibitor antiapoptotic bcl2 is associated with tumor genesis and chemotherapy resistance the bcl an antiapoptotic protein located in the mitochondrial membrane is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancy and is overexpressed in cll cell promoting clonal cell survival venetoclax is a potent and selective member of the bh3 mimetic drug and a physiologic antagonist of bcl venetoclax ha demonstrated quick and durable response in nave and relapsed or refractory cll rr cll patient including highrisk patient furthermore it ha shown deeper response achieving a higher incidence of negative minimal residual disease mrd with a fixed duration therapy in the past decade there wa a remarkable progress in cll treatment however neither of the new target therapy is considered curative or free of toxicity this article will focus on the treatment approach of cll patient with bcl2 antagonist treatment strategy combined versus monotherapy continuous versus limited duration therapy toxicity profile and future direction will be exposed in this review

Abstract: an alternative to reduce the undesirable effect of antineoplastic agent ha been the combination of classical treatment with nutritional strategy aimed at reducing systemic toxicity without decreasing the antitumor activity of already used drug within this context this study evaluated the possible reduction of toxicity when cisplatin treatment is combined with watermelon pulp juice supplementation in c57bl6 mouse with melanoma watermelon is a fruit rich in vitamin mineral protein lycopene carotene and xanthophyll which ha shown effectiveness in the treatment of cardiovascular disease weight loss urinary infection gout hypertension and mutagenicity the following parameter were analyzed animal survival bone marrow genotoxicity serum creatinine and urea histopathological feature of the tumor tissue tumor weight and volume and weight of nontumor tissue kidney liver spleen heart and lung the result showed that watermelon had no antitumor effect but reduced the toxicity of cisplatin a demonstrated by an increase in the number of bone marrow cell and a decrease in serum creatinine and urea level the data suggest that watermelon pulp juice can be an alternative for reducing the side effect of antineoplastic agent

Abstract: the design of anticancer therapy with high antitumour efficacy and reduced toxicity continues to be challenging anticancer prodrug and antibodydrugconjugate adc strategy that can specifically and efficiently deliver cytotoxic compound to cancer cell have been used to overcome some of the challenge the key to the success of many of these strategy is a selfimmolative linker which after activation can release the drug payload various type of triggerable selfimmolative linkers are used in prodrugs and adcs to improve their efficacy and safety numerous patent have reported the significance of selfimmolative linkers in prodrugs and adcs in cancer treatment based on the recent patent literature we summarise method for designing the sitespecific activation of nontoxic prodrugs and adcs in order to improve selectivity for killing cancer cell in this review an integrated view of the potential use of prodrugs and adcs in cancer treatment are provided this review present recent patent and related publication over the past ten year uptill the recent patent literature ha been summarised for a wide variety of selfimmolative pabc linkers which are cleaved by factor including responding to the difference between the extracellular and intracellular environment ph ro glutathione through overexpressed enzyme cathepsin plasmin glucuronidase or bioorthogonal activation the mechanism for selfimmolation involves the linker undergoing a or elimination via electron cascade or intramolecular cyclisation to release cytotoxic drug at the targeted site this review provides the commonly used strategy from recent patent literature in the development of prodrugs based on targeted cancer therapy and antibodydrug conjugate which show promise in therapeutic application
