# Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Extraction and Reasoning
Project Overview
This project aims to develop methodologies that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with existing biomedical data and unstructured text to create and validate knowledge graphs. These knowledge graphs will facilitate sophisticated reasoning over complex real-world data, enhancing data interpretability and decision-making capabilities. The project will involve building synthetic reference datasets, implementing performance metrics, and developing various systems to manage knowledge graph extraction, querying, and transformation.

# Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
* Implement performance metric for question answering based on AI-based knowledge graph extraction.
* Implement LLM-based question answering based on a database containing a knowledge graph.
* Develop approach extracting knowledge graphs from unstructured texts.
* Develop approach to harmonize, merge and query knowledge graphs.
* Develop approach to convert a knowledge graph back to unstructured texts.
